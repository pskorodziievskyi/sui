    "error[E06001]: unused value without 'drop'\n",
    "```\n",

    "This error is fundamental to understanding Move's **resource safety** and **ownership system**.\n",

    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you will understand:\n",
    "- Move's ability system and the `drop` ability\n",

    "# 1️⃣ Understanding Move Abilities and the Drop Ability\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Abilities in Move?\n",
    "\n",
    "Move's **ability system** controls what operations can be performed on values of a given type. There are four abilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Ability | Permission | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **`copy`** | Can be duplicated | Simple values like numbers |\n",
    "| **`drop`** | Can be discarded (unused) | Temporary data structures |\n",
    "| **`store`** | Can be stored inside other structs | Fields of objects |\n",
    "| **`key`** | Can have global identity | Sui objects |\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `drop` Ability Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The `drop` ability allows a value to be **automatically destroyed** when it goes out of scope without being explicitly consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without `drop`:\n",
    "```move\n",
    "// This struct CANNOT be dropped automatically\n",
    "struct Resource has key {\n",
    "    id: UID,\n",
    "    value: u64\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### With `drop`:\n",
    "```move\n",
    "// This struct CAN be dropped automatically\n",
    "struct TempData has drop {\n",
    "    count: u64,\n",
    "    flag: bool\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does Move Enforce This?\n",
    "\n",
    "Move's design principle: **\"Resources must be explicitly handled\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents:\n",
    "- 🚫 Accidental loss of valuable resources (tokens, NFTs)\n",
    "- 🚫 Memory leaks in resource management\n",
    "- 🚫 Unintended destruction of important data"

    "   │                   -------- To satisfy the constraint, the 'drop' ability would need to be added here\n",

    "   │                                 -------- The type does not have the ability 'drop'\n",
    "23 │         //TODO: add sender check\n",
    "24 │         let mut new_n = n; // Why do we need it?\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "1. **Line 24**: `let mut new_n = n;` - We move the `Notebook` into `new_n`\n",
    "2. **Line 25**: `new_n.owner = new_owner;` - We modify the owner field\n",
    "3. **Function ends**: `new_n` goes out of scope but is never consumed\n",
    "4. **Error**: `Notebook` doesn't have `drop` ability, so it can't be automatically destroyed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens:\n",
    "The `Notebook` struct is declared as:\n",
    "```move\n",
    "public struct Notebook has key { id: UID, owner: address, body: String }\n",
    "```\n",

    "# 7️⃣ Key Takeaways and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Error Root Cause:\n",
    "- Move prevents values without `drop` from being unused\n",
    "- This enforces **resource safety** and prevents accidental loss\n",
    "- Objects (structs with `key`) should be explicitly consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution Pattern:\n",
    "1. **Always consume values** - don't let them go unused\n",
    "2. **Use `transfer::transfer()`** to move objects to new owners\n",
    "3. **Use destructuring** when you need to extract and reuse parts\n",
    "4. **Add proper access control** with `assert!` checks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Best Practices for Sui Move\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Do:\n",
    "- Always transfer objects instead of dropping them\n",
    "- Add owner checks before allowing modifications\n",
    "- Use meaningful error constants\n",
    "- Implement complete TODOs to avoid unused values\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Don't:\n",
    "- Add `drop` to object types (structs with `key`)\n",
    "- Leave values unused at the end of functions\n",
    "- Skip security checks in transfer functions\n",
    "- Use placeholder TODOs in production code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Quick Fix Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see \"unused value without 'drop'\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Identify** the unused value\n",
    "2. ✅ **Consume** it by transferring, returning, or destructuring\n",
    "3. ✅ **Verify** all paths consume the value\n",
    "4. ✅ **Test** that the code compiles and functions correctly"
